### We trained KSUCCA with unsupervised and supervised word embeddings models

## Unsupervised models:

These are unsupervised word embeddings that were generated using CBOW and SG from Word2Vec. They were trained with different hyperparameters ranges: (2,4,5,8,16) for window size, (150, 300, 600) for dimensions, and (5 to 50) epochs.
